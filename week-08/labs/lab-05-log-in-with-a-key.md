# Week 8 Lab 05 — Log In with a Key

**Student Name:** Jocelyn Jackson

**Date Completed:** 09/13/26

**Module:** 3 — Practical Cryptography  
**Submission Path:** `week-08/labs/lab-05-log-in-with-a-key.md`

> ## STOP — Protect secrets
> Never paste, upload, commit, or screenshot a password, passphrase, or private key. Do not run `cat` on any private-key file. Submit only the worksheet and the named screenshots. Keep all cryptographic files on the VM.

## How to Use This Lab

- **[TERMINAL]** means type or paste the command into the Cloud Heights terminal.
- **[WORKSHEET]** means type your response in this lab worksheet.
- Run commands in the order shown. Do not type the sample output.
- If your result does not match the stated success check, stop at the Troubleshooting box. Do not improvise with `sudo`, package installation, Azure settings, or SSH server configuration.

## Mission

Authorize the public key created in Lab 03 and prove that `analyst@localhost` authenticates with that key without falling back to the account password.

## What You Already Know

In Week 6, SSH used the `analyst` account password. Here, the server stores the public key in `authorized_keys`, while the private key stays in the client account. The same user, protocol, and destination remain; only the authentication method changes.

## Lab Environment / Pre-Lab Check

**Required prerequisite:** Complete Lab 03 first.

**[TERMINAL] Run:** test -f ~/.ssh/week8_analyst_ed25519 &&   test -f ~/.ssh/week8_analyst_ed25519.pub &&   echo "READY: Lab 03 key pair exists" ||   echo "STOP: complete Lab 03 before continuing"

```bash
whoami
cf-week8-check
test -f ~/.ssh/week8_analyst_ed25519 &&   test -f ~/.ssh/week8_analyst_ed25519.pub &&   echo "READY: Lab 03 key pair exists" ||   echo "STOP: complete Lab 03 before continuing"
```

**Continue only if:** `whoami` prints `analyst`, all checks report `PASS`, and the final line begins with `READY`.

### If the VM Stops

Return to **My Lab Environment** in the Lab Portal and start your assigned VM. A stopped or deallocated VM is not deleted; saved disk files remain.

## Predict First

**[WORKSHEET]** Does the private key need to be copied into `authorized_keys`? Explain.

```text
No, the private key does not need to be copied and should not be copied. Private keys should remain private for security purposes and should only be used for authentication.
```

## Guided Steps

### Step 1 — Prepare `authorized_keys`

**[TERMINAL] Run:** mkdir -p ~/.ssh, chmod 700 ~/.ssh,touch ~/.ssh/authorized_keys,chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.ssh
chmod 700 ~/.ssh
touch ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

### Step 2 — Add the Week 8 Public Key Once

**[TERMINAL] Run:** grep -qxF "$(cat ~/.ssh/week8_analyst_ed25519.pub)" ~/.ssh/authorized_keys   || cat ~/.ssh/week8_analyst_ed25519.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys

```bash
grep -qxF "$(cat ~/.ssh/week8_analyst_ed25519.pub)" ~/.ssh/authorized_keys   || cat ~/.ssh/week8_analyst_ed25519.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

This command adds the key only if an identical line is not already present.

### Step 3 — Confirm the Entry and Safe Permissions

**[TERMINAL] Run:** grep -c 'week8-analyst-key$' ~/.ssh/authorized_keys and

```bash
grep -c 'week8-analyst-key$' ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
stat -c '%a %n' ~/.ssh ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

**Required result:** The count is `1`; permissions show `700` for `.ssh` and `600` for `authorized_keys`.

**Evidence moment:** Capture this result as `week08-lab05-authorized-key-permissions.png`.

### Step 4 — Run the Public-Key-Only Proof

**[TERMINAL] Run:** ssh   -o PreferredAuthentications=publickey   -o PasswordAuthentication=no   -i ~/.ssh/week8_analyst_ed25519   analyst@localhost   'echo "AUTH_TEST=PUBLICKEY_SUCCESS"; whoami; hostname'

```bash
ssh   -o PreferredAuthentications=publickey   -o PasswordAuthentication=no   -i ~/.ssh/week8_analyst_ed25519   analyst@localhost   'echo "AUTH_TEST=PUBLICKEY_SUCCESS"; whoami; hostname'
```

If SSH asks whether to trust the host fingerprint, type `yes` and press Enter. If no fingerprint question appears, continue; `localhost` was already known. Do not delete `known_hosts` to force the question.

At `Enter passphrase for key`, enter the **Lab 03 key passphrase**. Do not enter the `analyst` account password.

**Required result:** AUTH_TEST=PUBLICKEY_SUCCESS analyst cf-student-13

```text
AUTH_TEST=PUBLICKEY_SUCCESS
analyst
cf-student-XX
```

The final hostname will contain your assigned VM number instead of `XX`.

**Evidence moment:** Capture the three result lines as `week08-lab05-publickey-auth-success.png`.

## Stop & Check

If the command asks for the `analyst` account password, reports `Permission denied`, or does not print `AUTH_TEST=PUBLICKEY_SUCCESS`, do not submit. The options in the proof command disable account-password fallback for this one test only; they do not change the VM server.

### Troubleshooting

1. Run `grep -c 'week8-analyst-key$' ~/.ssh/authorized_keys`; required value is `1`.
2. Run `stat -c '%a %n' ~/.ssh ~/.ssh/authorized_keys`; required values are `700` and `600`.
3. Run `ssh-keygen -lf ~/.ssh/week8_analyst_ed25519.pub`; it must show the Lab 03 key.
4. If any check fails, stop and contact the instructor. Do not edit `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`, use `sudo`, disable password authentication, or delete `known_hosts`.

## Explain

**[WORKSHEET]** In 4–5 sentences, compare Week 6 password authentication with this key-based test. State what changed and what stayed the same.

```text
In Week 6, SSH used password authentication, where the user entered a password to prove their identity. In this, key-based authentication uses a private key on the client and a matching public key stored in authorized keys on the server. What changed is the authentication method, because no password is needed when the key is used. What stayed the same is that SSH still securely connects to the server and verifies the identity before allowing access
```

## Analysis Questions

1. What changed between the Week 6 and Week 8 SSH logins?

```text
In Week 6, SSH used a password to log in, while in Week 8, it used SSH keys, with the private key on the computer and the public key.
```

2. What stayed the same?

```text
SSH is still used to securely connect to the remote server and verify that the user is authorized to access it.
```

3. Why does `authorized_keys` contain the public key rather than the private key?

```text
The authorized_keys file contains the public key, which is safe to share. The private key stays on the device and should be kept secured. SSH uses the public key to confirm that you have the matching private key without exposing the private key to the server.
```

4. Why is the forced proof stronger evidence than a normal successful SSH login?

```text
Forced proof is stronger because it shows that SSH key authentication is working, rather than just showing that the user was able to log in. It confirms that the correct private key was used to match the public key in authorized_keys.
```

5. How is the key passphrase different from the `analyst` account password?

```text
The key passphrase protects the private key, while the analyst account password authenticates the analyst's Azure account. The passphrase unlocks the private key, and the account password is used to log in to the account.
```
