**Module:** 3 — Practical Cryptography  
**Submission Path:** `week-08/labs/lab-04-prove-who-signed-it.md`

> ## STOP — Protect secrets
> Never paste, upload, commit, or screenshot a password, passphrase, or private key. Do not run `cat` on any private-key file. Submit only the worksheet and the named screenshots. Keep all cryptographic files on the VM.

## How to Use This Lab

- **[TERMINAL]** means type or paste the command into the Cloud Heights terminal.
- **[WORKSHEET]** means type your response in this lab worksheet.
- Run commands in the order shown. Do not type the sample output.
- If your result does not match the stated success check, stop at the Troubleshooting box. Do not improvise with `sudo`, package installation, Azure settings, or SSH server configuration.

## Mission

Create a separate signing key pair, sign the incident report, verify the original, then prove that the same signature fails against a changed copy.

## What You Already Know

A digital signature uses a private key to sign and the matching public key to verify. Verification supports integrity and authenticity claims about the key. It does not encrypt the report or prove which human physically used the private key.

## Lab Environment / Pre-Lab Check

**[TERMINAL] Run:** whoami, cf-week8-check, cd ~/cloud-heights/week8-cryptography, test ! -e keys/week8_signing_private.pem &&   test ! -e keys/week8_signing_public.pem &&   echo "READY: signing-key paths are unused" ||   echo "STOP: signing-key file already exists"

```bash
whoami
cf-week8-check
cd ~/cloud-heights/week8-cryptography
test ! -e keys/week8_signing_private.pem &&   test ! -e keys/week8_signing_public.pem &&   echo "READY: signing-key paths are unused" ||   echo "STOP: signing-key file already exists"
```

**Continue only if:** `whoami` prints `analyst`, all checks report `PASS`, and the final line begins with `READY`.

If it begins with `STOP`, do not overwrite or delete anything. Ask the instructor whether to resume or reset.

### If the VM Stops

Return to **My Lab Environment** in the Lab Portal and start your assigned VM. A stopped or deallocated VM is not deleted; saved disk files remain.

## Predict First

**[WORKSHEET]** Should the original signature verify after the report content changes? Explain.

```text
No, the original signature should not verify once the report has been changed because the signature matches the original content. Any change to the report will cause the verification to fail and show that the file was modified.
```

## Guided Steps

### Step 1 — Generate the Private Signing Key

**[TERMINAL] Run:** openssl genpkey   -algorithm RSA   -aes-256-cbc   -pkeyopt rsa_keygen_bits:2048   -out keys/week8_signing_private.pem

```bash
openssl genpkey   -algorithm RSA   -aes-256-cbc   -pkeyopt rsa_keygen_bits:2048   -out keys/week8_signing_private.pem
```

Create one **signing-key passphrase** when prompted. You will use this same passphrase in Steps 2 and 4. Do not record or screenshot it.

### Step 2 — Derive the Public Key

**[TERMINAL] Run:** openssl pkey   -in keys/week8_signing_private.pem   -pubout   -out keys/week8_signing_public.pem

```bash
openssl pkey   -in keys/week8_signing_private.pem   -pubout   -out keys/week8_signing_public.pem
```

Enter the signing-key passphrase from Step 1.

### Step 3 — Confirm Both Files Exist

**[TERMINAL] Run:** ls -l keys/week8_signing_private.pem keys/week8_signing_public.pem

```bash
ls -l keys/week8_signing_private.pem keys/week8_signing_public.pem
```

Do not display the private-key contents.

### Step 4 — Sign the Original Report

**[TERMINAL] Run:** openssl dgst -sha256   -sign keys/week8_signing_private.pem   -out signatures/incident-report.sig   evidence/incident-report.txt

```bash
openssl dgst -sha256   -sign keys/week8_signing_private.pem   -out signatures/incident-report.sig   evidence/incident-report.txt
```

Enter the signing-key passphrase from Step 1.

### Step 5 — Verify the Original Report

**[TERMINAL] Run:** openssl dgst -sha256   -verify keys/week8_signing_public.pem   -signature signatures/incident-report.sig   evidence/incident-report.txt

```bash
openssl dgst -sha256   -verify keys/week8_signing_public.pem   -signature signatures/incident-report.sig   evidence/incident-report.txt
```

**Required result:** `Verified OK`

**Evidence moment:** Capture this result as `week08-lab04-signature-valid.png`.

### Step 6 — Change a Copy

**[TERMINAL] Run:** cp evidence/incident-report.txt signatures/incident-report-modified.txt and echo "Change: post-signature modification." >> signatures/incident-report-modified.txt

```bash
cp evidence/incident-report.txt signatures/incident-report-modified.txt
echo "Change: post-signature modification." >> signatures/incident-report-modified.txt
```

### Step 7 — Test the Original Signature Against the Changed Copy

**[TERMINAL] Run:** openssl dgst -sha256   -verify keys/week8_signing_public.pem   -signature signatures/incident-report.sig   signatures/incident-report-modified.txt

```bash
openssl dgst -sha256   -verify keys/week8_signing_public.pem   -signature signatures/incident-report.sig   signatures/incident-report-modified.txt
```

**Required result:** `Verification failure`. Additional OpenSSL error lines are normal for this intentional failure.

**Evidence moment:** Capture this result as `week08-lab04-signature-invalid-after-change.png`.

## Stop & Check

Do not create the changed copy until Step 5 returns `Verified OK`.

### Troubleshooting

- Step 2 or 4 cannot read the private key: re-enter the Step 1 signing-key passphrase.
- Step 5 reports failure: confirm you used the original report, public key, and signature paths exactly as shown.
- Step 7 reports `Verified OK`: run `tail -n 2 signatures/incident-report-modified.txt`. If the Change line is missing, repeat Step 6 once and rerun Step 7.

## Explain

**[WORKSHEET]** In 4–5 sentences, explain both verification results and why signing is not encryption.

```text
The original report had been verified, showing that the signature matched the report content. After the report was changed, the signature no longer verified because the contents were modified. Signing helps prove the integrity and authenticity of the file, but it does not hide the contents. Signing is not encryption because the signed report can still be read.
```

## Analysis Questions

1. What does `Verified OK` establish within this lab?

```text
Verified OK shows that the signature matches the file and that the file has not been changed since it was signed.
```

2. Why did the changed copy fail verification?

```text
The changed copy failed because its contents were different from the original file that was signed. The signature no longer matched the modified content.
```

3. Why is the signed report still readable?

```text
The signed report is still readable because signing does not encrypt or hide the file's contents. It only adds a signature that can be used to verify the file.
```

4. Why does the signature alone not prove which human used the private key?

```text
The signature proves that the matching private key was used, but it does not prove which person was actually using the key. Someone else could have had access to or used the private key.
```
