# Week 8 Lab 01 — Protect the Incident File

**Student Name:** Jocelyn Jackson

**Date Completed:** 09/13/26

**Module:** 3 — Practical Cryptography  
**Submission Path:** `week-08/labs/lab-01-protect-the-incident-file.md`

> ## STOP — Protect secrets
> Never paste, upload, commit, or screenshot a password, passphrase, or private key. Do not run `cat` on any private-key file. Submit only the worksheet and the named screenshots. Keep all cryptographic files on the VM.

## How to Use This Lab

- **[TERMINAL]** means type or paste the command into the Cloud Heights terminal.
- **[WORKSHEET]** means type your response in this lab worksheet.
- Run commands in the order shown. Do not type the sample output.
- If your result does not match the stated success check, stop at the Troubleshooting box. Do not improvise with `sudo`, package installation, Azure settings, or SSH server configuration.

## Mission

Encrypt a readable incident report, inspect the encrypted file safely, decrypt it, and prove the recovered file is identical to the original.

## What You Already Know

Encryption changes readable **plaintext** into protected **ciphertext**. In this lab, one passphrase protects and recovers the file. Encryption supports confidentiality, but it does not prevent someone from deleting or copying the encrypted file.

## Lab Environment / Pre-Lab Check

| Item | Required value |
|---|---|
| VM | Your assigned `cf-student-XX` VM |
| Linux account | `analyst` |
| Working directory | `~/cloud-heights/week8-cryptography` |
| Starting file | `evidence/incident-report.txt` |
| Estimated time | 25–35 minutes |

**[TERMINAL] Run:** cd ~/cloud-heights/week8-cryptography

```bash
whoami
hostname
cf-week8-check
cd ~/cloud-heights/week8-cryptography
pwd
```

**Continue only if:** `whoami` prints `analyst`, the hostname begins with `cf-student-`, every environment check reports `PASS`, and `pwd` ends with `/cloud-heights/week8-cryptography`.

### If the VM Stops

Return to **My Lab Environment** in the Lab Portal and start your assigned VM. A stopped or deallocated VM is not deleted; saved disk files remain.

## Predict First

**[WORKSHEET]** What do you expect to see when encrypted data is inspected as bytes? Why should it not look like the original report?

```text
You should see encrypted bytes instead of the original readable report. It should not look like the original report because encryption changes the data into an unreadable form to protect the data of the file.
```

## Guided Steps

### Step 1 — Confirm the Original Is Readable

**[TERMINAL] Run:** cat evidence/incident-report.txt

```bash
cat evidence/incident-report.txt
```

**Expected result:** A readable report beginning with `CLOUD HEIGHTS INCIDENT REPORT`.

### Step 2 — Encrypt the Report

Choose one temporary lab passphrase that you can re-enter during this lab. Do not write it in the worksheet.

**[TERMINAL] Run:**  openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -salt -pbkdf2 -iter 10000   -in evidence/incident-report.txt   -out encrypted/incident-report.enc

```bash
openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -salt -pbkdf2 -iter 100000   -in evidence/incident-report.txt   -out encrypted/incident-report.enc
```

At `enter AES-256-CBC encryption password:`, type the passphrase. Nothing may appear while you type; this is normal. Press Enter, type the same passphrase again, and press Enter.

**Expected result:** The prompt returns without an error message.

### Step 3 — Inspect the Encrypted File

**[TERMINAL] Run:** file encrypted/incident-report.enc and xxd -l 64 encrypted/incident-report.enc

```bash
file encrypted/incident-report.enc
xxd -l 64 encrypted/incident-report.enc
```

**Expected result:** `file` identifies data, and `xxd` displays hexadecimal bytes. The readable incident report does not appear.

**Evidence moment:** Capture the terminal now as `week08-lab01-encrypted-inspection.png`.

### Step 4 — Decrypt the File

**[TERMINAL] Run:** openssl enc -d -aes-256-cbc -pbkdf2 -iter 100000   -in encrypted/incident-report.enc   -out encrypted/incident-report-decrypted.txt

```bash
openssl enc -d -aes-256-cbc -pbkdf2 -iter 100000   -in encrypted/incident-report.enc   -out encrypted/incident-report-decrypted.txt
```

Enter the same passphrase from Step 2.

### Step 5 — Prove the Files Match

**[TERMINAL] Run:** cmp -s evidence/incident-report.txt encrypted/incident-report-decrypted.txt   && echo "MATCH: decrypted file equals original"   || echo "MISMATCH: stop and troubleshoot"

```bash
cmp -s evidence/incident-report.txt encrypted/incident-report-decrypted.txt   && echo "MATCH: decrypted file equals original"   || echo "MISMATCH: stop and troubleshoot"
```

**Required result:** `MATCH: decrypted file equals original`

**Evidence moment:** Capture the terminal now as `week08-lab01-decryption-match.png`.

## Stop & Check

Do not submit unless both required evidence moments succeeded.

### Troubleshooting

- `bad decrypt` or `bad password read`: rerun Step 4 and enter the exact Step 2 passphrase.
- `No such file or directory`: run `cd ~/cloud-heights/week8-cryptography`, then rerun the failed step.
- `MISMATCH`: delete only the decrypted copy with `rm -f encrypted/incident-report-decrypted.txt`, then repeat Steps 4–5.

## Explain

**[WORKSHEET]** In 3–4 sentences, explain how this lab demonstrates confidentiality and why encryption does not prevent deletion.

```text
This lab demonstrates confidentiality because encryption changes the original report into unreadable data, protecting it from unauthorized access. Only someone with the correct key is able to decrypt and read the file. Encryption does not prevent someone from deleting the encrypted file. Encryption protects the content of the file, but it does not protect the file from being deleted.
```

## Analysis Questions

1. Why can an encrypted file still be copied or deleted?

```text
An encrypted file can be copied and deleted because the file itself is not encrypted, but the contents of the file are encrypted. This file can be deleted and copied and still remain encrypted.
```

2. What job did the passphrase perform?

```text
The passphrase acts as a security measure to help protect the file and make sure only someone with the correct passphrase can access it.
```

3. Why does the match test prove correct recovery but not prove who handled the file?

```text
The match test only shows that the recovered file is the same as the original file. It does not show who actually handled or accessed the file. The test proves the file was recovered, but it doesn't identify the person who handled the file
```
